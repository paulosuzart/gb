gb is a stress test tool based on Apache Benchmark. It has zero dependencies, so you should be able to build the projet and start using it.


Running gb:

 ./gb -t http://localhost:8089 -c 2 -n 100

the output should be something like:

   2011/04/22 00:38:29 Starting requests...
   2011/04/22 00:38:29 Total Go Benchmark time 157 miliseconds.
   2011/04/22 00:38:29 200 requests performed. Average response time 0.8225 miliseconds.
   2011/04/22 00:38:29 0 requests lost.
   2011/04/22 00:38:29 Job done.

It will start two Workers to request 100 times each.

Available parameters by now are:
-t target. It may change, bu represents the target http server.
-c concurrent. Number of clients to perform the requests.
-n requests. Number of request each client should perform.
-A username:password. For Http Basic Authentication.
-M mode: standalone, master, worker.
-H host: Master host. Used for distributed gb in master mode.
-W worker host: Worker Host. Used for distributed gb in worker mode.
